Introduction
When you have a list of email addresses you want to compare to AD and see what email addresses are actually present in Active Directory, you can use this PS script.

This PS script will go through all emails in the list and compare to AD and produce 2 txt files including all email addresses found in AD and email addresses not found in AD.
